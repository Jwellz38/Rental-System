3.1.2 Hardware Interface

Users of the "Aquatic Center Tracking System" will interface directly with 
various hardware components. Here is a description of the components and 
configurations of this hardware:

	Option 1: IBM-Compatible PC Base Station
	This is a PC-based station on which customers could register or 
	log into the system. Here are its components, interfaces and advantages:
	Laptop Unit:	
		Components:
		1. ethernet (preferably wireless) web-capable network card
		2. onboard graphical display. 
		3. onboard keyboard for input.
		4. onboard touchpad for input.
		5. optional USB mouse.
		6. Optional USB full-sized keyboard.
		7. Optional HDMI large-screen display.

		Mechanical:
		1. possible locking cable to prevent theft of hardware.
		2. possible ground-mount on which hardware is secured.

		Not Implemented:
		1. the onboard microphone, which could potentially be used for voice capture rather than typing.
		2. the onboard camera, which could potentially be used for photo identification.
		3. the onboard sound device, which could potentially be used to give audio feedback per user action.

		Advantages:
		1. is portable.
		2. has the advantage of having a built-in display so that a seperate monitor is not required.
		3. users will use the built-in keyboard to type or enter information.
		4. users will use the touchpad.

		Disadvantages:
		1. small screen size may make viewing uncomfortable.
		2. small onboard keyboard may make typing more difficult or uncomfortable.
		3. small onboard touchpad may make cursor movement more difficult or uncomfortable.
		4. small size of laptop leaves it more susceptible to theft if not using locking device or ground-mount.
